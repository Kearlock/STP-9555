      <h1>Welcome to the Realm</h1>
      <h2>Step into a storybook kingdom locked in time and ice</h2>
      <p>
        Enter Enchanted Kingdom: Frost Curse, where an age-old battle between
        light and darkness has reached a chilling climax. As the rightful heir,
        you're thrust into a kingdom teetering on the edge of ruin—its magic
        faltering, its people silenced, its crown abandoned. The realm is rich
        with ancient history, elemental forces, and mysterious alliances
      </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        From opulent throne rooms to frostbitten glades, every corner holds
        secrets. You won’t just observe this story—you’ll shape it through
        clever decisions and determined exploration. Whether you're a hidden
        object veteran or a newcomer to the genre, prepare to lose yourself in a
        realm where every snowflake carries a story

      <h2>Storyline</h2>
      <h3>The frost came without warning. The betrayal was no accident</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
          After the king's sudden death, you—his only living descendant—must
          face your bloodline’s darkest truth: a banished sorceress has
          returned, wielding a frost curse born of forgotten magic. Her plan is
          clear—freeze the kingdom, control its magic, and rewrite its history
          with her at the helm
        </p>
      </div>

        <img src="" alt="Castle" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          But there’s still hope. Guided by your father’s last journal and the
          memories of a once-proud empire, you must reclaim the relics of the
          royal bloodline and ignite dormant magical sanctuaries. Along your
          path, you’ll forge bonds with spellcasters, battle cursed beasts, and
          make impossible decisions
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Every step forward unravels more of the truth—and brings you closer to a
        final confrontation that will define the kingdom’s future

    <div>
      <img src="" alt="Magnifying Glass" />
      <p>
        In Enchanted Kingdom, your wits are your strongest weapon. Each chapter
        introduces beautifully illustrated scenes teeming with hidden objects,
        enchanted mechanisms, and logic-based conundrums
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="" alt="Golden Key" />
      <p>
        Seek out items tucked beneath snowdrifts, decode cryptic runes, and
        assemble relics that unlock ancient passageways. Puzzles vary in
        complexity and style—from elemental matching games to rotating magic
        rings that power enchanted gates
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="" alt="Gameplay Scene" />
      <p>
        Hidden object scenes are dynamic, with some items revealed only after
        triggering special actions. The hint system is robust yet optional—great
        for players who enjoy a challenge or those who want a helping hand
